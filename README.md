# Ankiverse: Memorize poetry with Anki

Ankiverse is a simple web app that breaks lines of text into Anki cards in CSV
format in the following form:

> Line 1  
> Line 2  
> Line 3  
> Line 4  
>
> ------  
> Line 5  
> Line 6

This means the prompt for each line is its immediate context, and also provides
overlap between memorized lines.

The number of lines on front and back are customizable, and the app can also
fetch Bible passages and automatically split them up into sensible lines.

The technique is derived from the examples on this page:
